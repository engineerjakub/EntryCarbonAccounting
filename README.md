# Entry Carbon Accounting Project: GHG Protocol Report of a Car Rental Company

Project Description:
This paper serves to detail an introductory 2-week carbon accounting project based on a
fabricated car rental business, using Greenhouse Gas Protocol reporting. It utilizes
application of fundamental carbon accounting techniques and is done in
the software PowerBI, a business tool meant to preprocess and analyze datasets and
aid comprehension of various projects between businesses and shareholders, via Data
visualization in dashboards.

In this repository, you may find the final report as well as the dataset used.

A GHGP report requires the following:
• Company description
• Organizational boundary; Consolidation approach
• Operational boundary
• Reporting period
• Total scope 1 and scope 2 emissions
• Emissions of all 7GHGs separately
• Base year and emissions profile over time
• Calculation methodologies
• Any exclusion of sources

Having used fabricated data, all but two bulletpoints were completed:
• Emissions of all 7GHGs separately -- Lack of Data regarding individual GHG gases, CO2 equivalent utilized.
• Base year and emissions profile over time -- Data was based only on 2023. It may have been possible to analyse multiple generated datasets, but this was not possible in the time constraint.

Most of the project time was dedicated to learning about the value chain of the car rental business, the relevant scope emissions, and the various techniques required to perform carbon accounting.

This project was largely guided by KPMG for the European Rental Association, which detailed methods of calculating emissions through the use of emission factors in various methods. Emission factors may be gathered via:
Supplier Data
Average-based Data
Spend-based Data

Due to the fabricated nature of this study, average-based and spend-based data was utilized, to gain estimations from secondary data sources.

The guide also brifed various emission calculation methods including: 
- Consumption based methods for scope 1 and scope 3 emissions
- Location-based and Market-based method for scope 2 emissions
